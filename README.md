# carPortal
carPortal brings to life the idea from Assignment 3 (A3) of CIS*2500, transitioning from a CLI-based car management system to a modern, web-enabled application. Leveraging MongoDB, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, this platform offers a more accessible and intuitive experience for managing a car inventory.
